    The "File Upload cloud" project allows users to easily upload files, including images and videos, to a server. Users can choose a file to upload and even reduce its size if needed. Once the file is successfully uploaded, an email notification is sent from the server.
    This project utilizes several key packages to make it work seamlessly. "<b>nodemailer</b>" is used to handle the email notifications, ensuring that users are informed when their files have been uploaded. "<b>express</b>" and "<b>mongoose</b>" help manage the server and database interactions, respectively. "<b>cloudinary</b>" plays a crucial role in storing and managing the uploaded files in the cloud, making them easily accessible and scalable. Finally, "<b>express-fileupload</b>" simplifies the process of handling file uploads within the Express framework.
